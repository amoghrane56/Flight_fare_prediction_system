# Flight_fare_prediction_system

Welcome to the Flight Fare Prediction System repository! This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict flight fares based on various factors. This README file will provide you with essential information about the system, its features, and how to use it effectively.

System Overview:

The Flight Fare Prediction System is built using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical flight data and predict fares for new flight bookings. By leveraging the power of data and predictive modeling, this system aims to provide accurate fare estimates, helping travelers plan their trips more efficiently.

Key Features:

Data Collection: The system utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing flight-related information, including departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airlines, flight durations, and other relevant features. This data is crucial for training the machine learning model.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step involves techniques such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables to ensure the data is suitable for the machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering: The system may employ feature engineering techniques to derive additional features from the existing dataset. This helps enhance the predictive power of the model and capture important patterns or relationships.

Model Training: The machine learning model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. The system employs regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to learn from the historical flight data and establish a correlation between input features and flight fares.

Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as root mean squared error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE). This assessment ensures that the model provides accurate fare predictions.

Fare Prediction: Once the model is trained and validated, it is ready to make predictions on new flight bookings. Users can input relevant flight details, such as departure and arrival locations, travel dates, airlines, and other features, and the system will generate an estimated fare for the given itinerary.

Usage Instructions:

Dataset: Ensure that you have a comprehensive flight dataset to train the model. The dataset should include relevant features (input variables) and the corresponding flight fares (target variable).

Environment Setup: Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies, including machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Apply appropriate techniques for cleaning the data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training: Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset. Experiment with different regression algorithms and hyperparameter configurations to optimize the model's performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using suitable evaluation metrics. This step ensures the model's accuracy and provides insights for further improvements.

Fare Prediction: Deploy the trained model to make fare predictions on new flight bookings. Create a user-friendly interface that accepts input data and returns the estimated fare for the given itinerary.
